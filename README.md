## What It Does

1. **Choose a Guide** — 25 built-in personas across four temperaments (contemplative, showman, somatic, authoritarian), each with a distinct voice, vocabulary, and therapeutic style. Create unlimited custom personas.

2. **Choose a Method** — 37 induction techniques across five categories: therapeutic, somatic, demonstration, rapid, and advanced. Methods unlock progressively — rapid at 3 completed sessions, advanced at 7 — so beginners build foundational experience first.

3. **Set an Intention** — 20 intention types from emotional state shifts and post-hypnotic triggers through pain management, sleep induction, and behavioural conditioning. The AI crafts a technically-precise hypnotic suggestion from a rough description. Add your own personal affirmations — the AI weaves them verbatim into deepening and work phases.

4. **Configure** — Session length (2–30 minutes), voice selection with quality scoring, 19 procedural soundscapes, 16 visual effects with live tuning (speed, intensity, complexity, trail), pitch/volume/speed controls, ducking toggle, and per-element HUD toggles. All settings auto-save between sessions.

5. **Generate & Begin** — Per-phase AI generation produces each section individually for higher quality, with live neon progress indicators (dark → amber streaming → green complete → red/yellow error with click-to-retry). Edit the script, then begin a fully narrated, visually guided session with real-time controls.

**Or** — click "I already have a script" on Step 1 to skip configuration entirely, paste your own script, and begin immediately.

## Features

### Audio
- **19 procedural soundscapes** — engine drone, rain (Poisson-scheduled droplets), ocean waves, crackling fire, singing bowls (additive synthesis), heartbeat, binaural beats (theta 6Hz via ChannelMerger), pink/brown/white noise, forest (birds and breeze), stream (flowing water), wind (gusting), distant thunder, wind chimes, cave (sparse drips with echo), night crickets (chirping insects), temple (deep bell and tonal drones), and spaceship (low engine hum with sci-fi bleeps). All synthesised in real-time with the Web Audio API — no audio files, never loops audibly.
- **Narration ducking** — soundscape volume automatically dips to 20% during speech, ramps back between sentences. Toggleable in Configure.
- **Voice quality scoring** — voices sorted by neural/natural/enhanced quality with tier badges.
- **Ambience recording** — record the procedural soundscape to a downloadable `.webm` file via MediaRecorder.
- **Media Session API** — lock-screen play/pause/stop controls on mobile.

### Visuals
- **16 Canvas 2D renderers** — spiral, breathing circle (4-7-8 pacer with haptic feedback), tunnel, starfield warp, candle focal, moiré interference, vortex, mandala, pendulum harmonograph, lissajous, colour wash, flow-field particles, plasma, canvas pulse, and two kaleidoscope meta-effects wrapping flow field and plasma.
- **Live visual tuning** — speed (0.1×–2.0×), intensity, complexity, and trail/fade sliders update the active effect in real-time.
- **Phase-reactive speed** — visuals slow during settling (0.5×) and deepener (0.7×), composited with user speed setting.
- **Live switching** — change the visual mid-session without interruption.
- **Warm sleep overlay** — blue-light-reducing CSS filter auto-activates for sleep intention sessions.
- **Reduced motion** — `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations; manual Off/Gentle/Full override.

### Session Player
- **Five-phase playback** with progress bar, phase dots, elapsed time, and current-sentence text display.
- **Keyboard controls** — Space pauses/resumes (including soundscape audio via AudioContext suspend/resume), Escape emergency-ends.
- **Back to script** — return to the script editor mid-session to edit and restart.
- **Fullscreen mode** with auto-hiding controls.
- **Screen Wake Lock** prevents display timeout during sessions, re-acquires on tab visibility.
- **Live settings panel** — slide-out panel for adjusting visual, audio, and HUD elements mid-session.
- **Script transcript** — toggle a full-text view of the script during playback.
- **Double induction** — the Double Induction method automatically picks a contrasting second voice and speaks both simultaneously.
- **Persona-matched emergency re-alerts** — 25 unique re-alert scripts, one per persona, each in that persona's voice.
- **Grounding exercise** — 5-4-3-2-1 senses exercise auto-displayed after emergency end or low alertness.

### AI Generation
- **Per-phase generation** — each script phase (settling, induction, deepener, work, emergence) is generated by an individual AI call for higher quality. Each call receives a running summary of prior phases so the AI continues seamlessly without repetition.
- **Dynamic phase count** — longer sessions get multiple work phases (medium: 2, long: 3) with affirmation interludes between them.
- **Affirmation weaving** — user-authored affirmations are delivered as poetic interludes between work phases, using the user's exact words in the persona's voice.
- **Live progress indicators** — neon-styled phase dots with five states: dark (pending), pulsing amber (streaming), green (complete), red (failed), yellow (unhandled error). Click any red or yellow indicator to retry just that phase.
- **Adaptive ETA** — live countdown estimate that calibrates from actual phase completion times.
- **Suggestion crafter** — converts rough intentions into technically-precise hypnotic suggestions.
- **20 intention types** with specific AI guidance for each (trigger-response links, pain-dial metaphors, conditioning protocols, amnesia framing, etc.).

### Clinical Features (Research-Backed)
- **First-run contraindication checklist** — 6 clinical conditions (psychosis, DID, epilepsy, suicidality, under-18 unaccompanied, intoxication) with explicit attestation. Re-displays monthly.
- **0-10 state scale** — pre-session and post-session wellbeing measurement matching clinical VAS/NRS scales.
- **Howard Alertness Scale** — post-session 0-10 alertness check. Auto-triggers the grounding exercise if alertness falls below 5.
- **Rising-score sparkline** — Canvas chart showing pre vs post improvement across the last 20 scored sessions. Users see their own therapeutic progress.
- **Post-session journal** — reflection textarea saved to session history for pattern tracking.
- **Session daily cap** — maximum 3 sessions per day with kind messaging to prevent compulsive use.
- **Crisis resources** — always-visible footer link with direct numbers: 988 (US), Samaritans (UK/IE), Lifeline (AU), Talk Suicide (CA), findahelpline.com.

### Structured Programs
- **5 multi-day programs** with IDB-stored day progression, prior-anchor tracking, and AI context injection:
  - 🌙 7-Day Sleep — body scan → staircase → safe place → anchor → dream rehearsal → integration
  - 🍃 14-Day Calm — breath → worry containment → trigger desensitization → resilience → future pacing
  - 🦁 10-Day Confidence — inner critic → posture anchor → voice of authority → identity integration
  - 💊 6-Week Pain — structured pain management following the clinical gut-directed model
  - 🎯 7-Day Focus — attention narrowing → flow state → sustained immersion → autonomous flow

### Quick-Start Presets
- **12 clinical-vertical presets** — Sleep, Quick Calm, Deep Focus, Demo Night, Pain Relief, Micro Reset, Anxiety Relief, Confidence, Peak Flow, Habit Change, Creative Flow, Energy Boost. One click sets guide, method, intention, soundscape, and length.

### Data & Tracking
- **IndexedDB storage** with automatic localStorage migration. `navigator.storage.persist()` prevents browser clearing.
- **Session history** — last 50 sessions tracked with date, guide, method, duration, completion status, pre/post state scores, and journal entries.
- **Compassionate streak** — consecutive-day tracking with up to 2 auto-freeze days per streak (missing a single day doesn't break the streak, per habit-formation research).
- **Activity heatmap** — GitHub-style 16-week calendar visualisation.
- **Script library** — save, name, load, and delete generated scripts.
- **Full backup/restore** — export all personas, scripts, history, and active program state as a single JSON file. Import merges without overwriting.
- **Settings persistence** — all Configure tab settings (audio levels, voice selection, visual effect, viz tuning sliders, HUD toggles, ducking preference, soundscape) auto-save to localStorage with debounced batch writes. Slider saves fire only on release, text inputs debounce at 1500ms.

### Sharing & Export
- **Script export** — download any generated script as a `.txt` file with metadata header.
- **Config sharing** — compress session config to a URL fragment via `CompressionStream('gzip')`, share via Web Share API or clipboard.
- **Ambience recording** — download procedural soundscapes as `.webm` audio.

### Accessibility
- `aria-live` region announcing step changes.
- Focus management moving to step headings on navigation.
